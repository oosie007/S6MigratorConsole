# Push to GitHub

Your code is committed. To push:

1. **Create a new repo** at https://github.com/new  
   - Name: e.g. `S6MigratorConsole`  
   - Do **not** add README / .gitignore / license

2. **Add remote and push** (replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your GitHub username):

   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/S6MigratorConsole.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

3. If you use **SSH** instead of HTTPS:

   ```bash
   git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/S6MigratorConsole.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

After the first push you can delete this file.
